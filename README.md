# Traffic-Explorer
An iOS built to explore the data on traffic in real time (Singapore).

This project made use of "Clean architecture" with MVP (Model View Presenter) and Coordinator design pattern in iOS. It also does not contain any third-party library, all have been developed natively.

The idea behind the app architecture is to make use of Generics and common components and develop from there, even though there are only three screens, the Home, the Map screen, and the Pin Details screen.
